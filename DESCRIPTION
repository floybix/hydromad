Description: A modelling framework for environmental hydrology: water 
  balance accounting and flow routing in spatially aggregated catchments. 
  It supports simulation, estimation, assessment and visualisation of 
  flow response to time series of rainfall and other drivers.
  Includes models (such as IHACRES CWI, CMD), transfer function estimators
  (including SRIV - Simplified Refined Instrumental Variable), etc.
